# Things To Fix, Upgrade & Add In My Personal Website

## **Fix:**

1. The "Check out my projects." button in section **About** has its link only applied to the text not the whole button.
2. Fix Profile Picture in section **About** as it is not consistent with its parent container.
3. Loading the Chat Application can be laggy due to unneccessary chat re-renders.
4. Fix the footer by changing the creation year date to 2023.

## Upgrade

1. Use Npoint.io to store data including:
- Todo List
- Project List
- Calendar List
- *Blog Stuff?*
2. Upgrade section **Events** date effect (e.g. Colour of text or Delete event if passed after a couple days).

## Add

1. Add another section called **Blog**, for structured plans in the future.
2. Add more animations and end animation events (e.g. Loading, close animations.)
